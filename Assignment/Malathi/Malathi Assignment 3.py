Answer the questions or complete the tasks outlined in bold below, use the specific method described if applicable.

** What is 7 to the power of 4?**

7**4

"""** Split this string:**

    s = "Hi there Sam!"
    
**into a list. **
"""

S='Hi there Sam!'

S.split()

"""** Given the variables:**

    planet = "Earth"
    diameter = 12742

** Use .format() to print the following string: **

    The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
"""

planet="Earth"

diameter=12742
print('The diameter of {} is {} kilometers.' .format(planet,diameter));

"""** Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello" **"""

lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]

lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]
a=lst[3][1][2]
print(a)

"""** Given this nest dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky **"""

d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}

print(d['k1'][3]["tricky"][3]['target'][3])

"""** What is the main difference between a tuple and a list? **"""

Tuples are immutable whereas Lists are mutable. Tuples consumes less memory whereas Lists consume more memory. Tuples does not have many built-in methods whereas Lists have several built-in methods.

"""** Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form: **

    user@domain.com
    
**So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com**
