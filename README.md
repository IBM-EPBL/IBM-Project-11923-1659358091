Analytics for Hospitals' Health-Care Data


Recent Covid-19 Pandemic has raised alarms over one of the most overlooked are as to focus
which is absolutely Healthcare Data Management. While healthcare management has various
use cases for using data science, patient length of stay is one critical parameter to observe and
predict if one wants to improve the efficiencyof the healthcare management in a hospital. This
parameter helps hospitals to identify patients of high LOS-risk (patients who will stay longer)
at the time of admission. Once identified, patients with high LOS risk can have their treatment
plan optimized to minimize LOS and lower the chance of staff/visitor infection. Also, prior
knowledge of LOS can aid in logistics such as room and bed allocation planning. The goal is
to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on case by case basis so that the
Hospitals can use this information for optimal resourceallocation and better functioning. The
length of stay is divided into 11 different classes ranging from 0-10 days to more than 100
days. The tools that we are using for data analytics is Cognos Analytics.
